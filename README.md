# simple-calculator-app
Non-overengineered and very simple calculator app that uses a mathematical grammar to compile both simple and complex expressions as an illustration of my understanding of Compilers and Interpreters.


## Install instructions
- Install Python 3 -> guide can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Using your preferred terminal, navigate to the location of this file
- Once you are in the correct directory, execute `python3 main` and it will open the tkinter window
  - TKinter should come preinstalled with Python 3, but if not you can find it [here](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)

## Use instructions
- Enter your calculation using the keypad (or type into the box) **DO NOT ENTER BRACKETS - THEY ARE UNIMPLEMENTED!!!!**
- Press `=`
- You can store results by clicking `M+` -> this will input the calculation in the window into memory
- You can recall results by clicking `MR` -> this will input the saved calculation into the window
